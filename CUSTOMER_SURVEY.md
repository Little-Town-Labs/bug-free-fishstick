## Survey Analysis Guide (For Austin's Use)

### Key Metrics to Track

**Validation Signals (Green Lights):**
- ✅ 70%+ respond to 6+ RFPs per year (sufficient volume)
- ✅ 60%+ spend $2,000+ per RFP in labor (clear cost pain)
- ✅ 70%+ rate AI extraction as 4-5/5 valuable (feature validation)
- ✅ 50%+ willing to pay $200+/month (viable pricing)
- ✅ 30%+ interested in beta testing (early adopters exist)

**Warning Signals (Red Flags):**
- ⚠️ Most respond to <5 RFPs/year (market too small)
- ⚠️ Win rate >50% (no pain point - already winning)
- ⚠️ Time per RFP <2 days (not painful enough)
- ⚠️ Budget <$100/month (can't support business model)
- ⚠️ "Not valuable" ratings across all features (wrong solution)

**Pivot Signals:**
- If team collaboration (feature g) rates higher than AI drafting (feature d) → pivot to collaboration tool
- If extraction (feature a) rates 5/5 but drafting (feature d) rates 2/5 → focus on Loop 1 only
- If enterprise respondents want on-premise → need different architecture

### Follow-Up Interview Questions

For respondents who rated high value + willing to pay + interested in beta:

1. **Process Deep Dive**
   - "Walk me through your last RFP response from receipt to submission."
   - "What was most frustrating about that specific RFP?"

2. **Willingness to Pay Validation**
   - "You indicated $X/month - what would you expect for that price?"
   - "How do you justify software purchases at your company?"

3. **Feature Prioritization**
   - "If we could only build one feature in the first version, what should it be?"
   - "What would make this a 'must-have' vs. 'nice-to-have'?"

4. **Competitive Landscape**
   - "What have you tried already? What didn't work?"
   - "Why didn't existing tools solve this problem?"

5. **Beta Testing Commitment**
   - "Would you commit to processing 5 RFPs through our beta?"
   - "Can you introduce us to others in your organization?"

SLIDE 1: TITLE
================================================================================
RFP AUTOMATOR
"Automate Proposal Responses with AI"

Transform days of manual work into minutes of intelligent automation.
Level the playing field for B2B and B2G sales teams.

================================================================================
SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
================================================================================
Organizations responding to RFPs (Healthcare, Engineering, Services) face:

⏱️ THE MANUAL ENTRY TAX
- Days-to-weeks per proposal response.
- Sales/Marketing teams buried in repetitive data entry.
- Constant copy-pasting from outdated "Win" files.

📄 FORMAT CHAOS
- Complex multi-page PDFs, Word docs and CSVs.
- Proprietary web portals with character limits.
- No single tool handles both documents and web links.

🔍 KNOWLEDGE FRAGMENTATION
- Company info scattered across Slack, Email, and old PDFs.
- Technical specs and past project outcomes are hard to find.
- Inconsistent branding and messaging across different bids.

================================================================================
SLIDE 3: THE OPPORTUNITY
================================================================================
The Multi-Sector RFP Market:

- GOVERNMENT: $700B+ annual US government contracts.
- CORPORATE: Trillions in private sector procurement (Healthcare, Tech, Construction).
- THE COST: Average RFP response costs $5k - $25k in labor.
- THE BOTTLENECK: Most companies only bid on 20% of qualified leads due to capacity.

"If you could respond to 3x more RFPs with the same team and better quality?"

================================================================================
